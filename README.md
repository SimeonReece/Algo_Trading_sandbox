## Instructions

1. Install Flask:
   ```bash
   pip install flask
   ```

3. Install Faker:
   ```bash
   pip install faker
   ```

4. Update pip:
```python.exe -m pip install --upgrade pip```
4. I suggest running each Python file individually for error checking and better understanding.

5. To run the main file, use:

   - In VS Code, run the file [`displayObject.py`](http://displayobject.py/) with:
     ```bash
     python displayObject.py
     ```

6. To view the application, go to [http://127.0.0.1:5000/](http://127.0.0.1:5000/) in your browser.
